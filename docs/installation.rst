Installation
------------

This is just a demonstration vehicle used to take you through the process
-- start to finish -- of creating a Python project that can be:

	1. Uploaded to
	2. Distributed from

	and

	3. Documented on

the Python Package Index (aka pypi or the cheeseshop) at http://pypi.python.org/pypi.
This project uses :mod:`setuptools`, :mod:`sphinx`, and the :mod:`Sphinx-PyPI-upload`
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx-PyPI-upload/0.2.1).

.. note::

	The major goal is to show how to create a 'one-click' script that can build
	and upload both your project and your documentation to pypi.  This way, any
	time you make a minor version change to your project, it's simple to get it
	updated for distribution.

This demonstration is not meant to be complete nor authoritative. It's just a
recording of the steps I took to get some projects onto pypi and
hopefully it might save someone some time from googling around.  To be sure,
this is simply just *one* way to make a project, document it, and get it
on pypi.

NOTE: This was originally given as a talk to the Minnesota Python Users Group
http://groups.google.com/group/pymntos/ and was developed for a
spoken presentation format.
